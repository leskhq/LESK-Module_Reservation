# Reservation module

To deploy simply clone the repository into the ```Modules``` directory from the base or root [LESK](https://github.com/sroutier/laravel-enterprise-starter-kit) install, as shown below:
```
$ cd <MySuperProjectBasedOnLESK>
$ git clone https://github.com/sroutier/LESK-Module_Reservation.git app/Modules/Reservation

```
